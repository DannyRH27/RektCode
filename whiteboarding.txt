PROBLEM 1:
You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Note: Given n will be a positive integer.


1. Have a results array prepopulated with 1 and 2.
2. I will do this operation n times
3. results will shovel in the two last inputs i put in.
4. i will return the last number in the array (the one i just put in)

def climb_stairs(n)
    return 0 if n == 0
    res = [0,1]

    n.times do
        res << (res[-1] + res[-2])
    end

    res[-1]
end
