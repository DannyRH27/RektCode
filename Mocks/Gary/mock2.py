  Part 2: Given N deliveries, print out all the possible routes

  Examples: N = 1 -> [p1, d1] 
  N = 2 -> [p1, d1, p2, d2], [p1, p2, d1, d2], [p1, p2, d2, d1], [p2, d2, p1, d1], [p2, p1, d1, d2], [p2, p1, d2, d1]

at any given moment, i need to know what i can possibly put there
i can try this recursively and see what's available to be added and continue adding until len(list is N8 2)

I could get all the permutations of possible routes,

i know i have N amount of pickups and N amount of deliveries that need to be made
so i'd just do a permutation on these two lists
run them through my validRoute function and then if it's true, then append to list of valid routes
return the valid routes
